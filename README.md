I am currently a junior at The University of Iowa double-majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics and Information Systems. 

I enjoy utilizing numbers to help me better understand solve problems. The field I am looking to pursue pertains to marketing research and marketing analytics. Using numbers to explain and demonstrate ideas is something I find intriguing.
